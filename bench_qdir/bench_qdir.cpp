/**
 * A benchmark for common QDir operations.
 *
 * Note that the tests should be compared between each other.
 * Individually, their absolute numbers don't have much meaning as they
 * depend on the number of files in your home dir, on whether you are using
 * an SSD, on your file system, etc. pp.
 *
 * But all the tests here do essentially the same, thus pick the faster pattern.
 *
 * A note on caches: the QBENCHMARK macro will repeat its context multiple time,
 * after the first iterations the file system caches will be hot and any difference
 * therein can be neglected as it drowns in the noise when we average over all
 * runs.
