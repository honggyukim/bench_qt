 * Various benchmarks related to the system allocator.
 *
 * Note that all test cases bench both, allocation and deallocation.
 * The returned numbers should roughly correspond to the cost of an allocation
 * or deallocation. It is tough to benchmark only allocation or deallocation,
 * as then the benchmarks easily allocate too much memory and go OOM.
 *
 * Furthermore note that most of these tests are somewhat best-case benchmarks
 * for the allocator: No threads are contending for the heap, the allocator
 * stays code stays in cache, ...
 *
 * Still, the results are interesting nonetheless.
