# Qt Benchmarks

This repository contains a collection of benchmarks that illustrate
common performance pitfalls when using Qt.

The goal is to propose multiple solutions to common problems and let
the performance numbers speak for themselves.

Note that Qt itself contains an extensive set of benchmarks. This
repo here does not aim to replace those, rather it should give an
easy overview of what to use where.
